-- ============================================================
-- Jobak — feedback
-- Applied in order by the migration runner (pnpm db:migrate). Safe to re-run.
-- ============================================================
--
-- A public form, so anyone can report a broken listing or ask for something
-- without an account. That makes this the only table in the schema an anonymous
-- request may write to, and the policies below are written around that.
--
-- **Insert-only for everyone.** There is deliberately no SELECT policy at all:
-- not for `anon`, not for `authenticated`. Feedback routinely contains a name,
-- an email and a complaint about a specific employer, and a public form whose
-- submissions are publicly readable is a leak waiting to be discovered. Only the
-- service role — which bypasses RLS — can read it, which means the Supabase
-- dashboard and the owner, and nothing that runs in a browser.

 * deliberate. This is the backstop: no more than five submissions a minute in

 * spam target and losing a burst of genuine feedback during an attack is a
 * better outcome than accepting the attack.
