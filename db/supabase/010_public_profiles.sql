--
-- Every other table in this schema is private by construction: RLS scopes each
-- row to `auth.uid()` and there is no path from an anonymous request to a user's
-- data. This file deliberately opens one. That makes it the highest-risk file in
-- the project, and it is written accordingly:
--
--   * **Off by default.** `is_public` starts false. A profile is published only
--     by an authenticated request from its own owner.
--   * **The view is the boundary.** Anonymous readers are granted `public_talent`
--     and nothing else — never `user_profiles`, never `user_preferences`. The
--     column list in that view is an allowlist, so a column added to a base
--     table later cannot leak by accident.
--   * **Email is never published.** Not in the view, not behind a toggle. It is
--     the one identifier that invites the spam this feature would otherwise
--     create.
--   * **Consent is recorded.** `published_at` is when they said yes, and it is
--     cleared when they say no.
--
-- The FAQ currently answers "Who can see my preferences and matches?" with
-- "Only you." That stays true for matches; update the answer for preferences
-- when this ships, because a published profile can show field and skills.
