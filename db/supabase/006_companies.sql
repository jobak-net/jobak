-- Applied in order by the migration runner (pnpm db:migrate), after 001_initial_schema.sql.
-- ============================================================
--
-- An aggregator's apply button is a redirect through the aggregator. What a
-- candidate wants is the employer: their site, their LinkedIn page, and the
-- careers page where the rest of their openings live — including the ones that
-- never got posted to a board at all.
--
-- Those three facts belong in their own table rather than on `jobs`, because
-- they change on a completely different clock. A company's website changes
-- roughly never; its open roles change hourly. Storing them per job would mean
-- re-resolving the same company on every collection run, and resolving one
-- company costs up to three outbound requests — see services/scraper/api/enrich.ts.
--
-- So: the collector inserts jobs as before, then enriches the companies it has
-- not seen recently, and every future job at that company is already answered.

  --   apply-url — the job's own apply link was already on a company domain
  --   guess     — a domain guess that proved itself against the page title.
  --               The only fallible one: it can still land on a different
  --               company with a similar name, so filter on this if you need
  --               facts rather than leads.
