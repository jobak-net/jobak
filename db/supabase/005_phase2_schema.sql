-- ── Search queue ────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Onboarding no longer waits for the collector. It records the request here,
-- answers the browser immediately, and triggers n8n after the response — so a
-- slow or unreachable n8n costs the user a wait instead of losing the search.
--
-- The row is also what the dashboard reads to say "still running" honestly,
-- rather than guessing from a fixed message.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS search_requests (
  id           UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id      UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  -- 'onboarding' is the free pass kicked off when the profile is first saved.
  -- 'dashboard'  is the user pressing Search, which may also spend Apify credit.

-- status transitions come from the app and from n8n, never from the browser.
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "own search requests" ON search_requests;

  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- ── Marketing ───────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Attribution, asked while the first collection runs rather than before it.
-- Its own table on purpose: the collectors read user_preferences on every run,
-- and this data has no business being in that path.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_marketing (
  user_id       UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

-- ── Collection cursor ───────────────────────────────────────
-- The hourly collector walks the job-title catalogue instead of collecting only
-- what current users asked for, so the pool is already warm when someone new
-- finishes onboarding.
--
-- The catalogue is far too large to sweep in one run, so this is the pointer:
-- each run takes the next slice and moves it along, wrapping at the end. One
-- row, enforced by the CHECK — a second row would silently give two collectors
-- two different ideas of where they are.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS collection_cursor (
  id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1 CHECK (id = 1),
  position   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO collection_cursor (id, position) VALUES (1, 0) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

ALTER TABLE collection_cursor ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- No policy on purpose: only the service role reads and advances it.

-- ── Bookmarking a pool job ──────────────────────────────────
-- The dashboard now lists jobs the matcher has not scored yet, so bookmarking
-- one has to create its match row rather than update an existing one. That
-- upsert needs this constraint, as does the matcher's own
-- `on_conflict=user_id,job_id`.
--
-- schema.sql declares it inline on the table; this is here because that file
-- was only partly applied to the live database. Guarded because ADD CONSTRAINT
-- has no IF NOT EXISTS form.
