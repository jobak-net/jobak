-- ============================================================
-- Jobak — public job pages, and the LinkedIn posting queue
-- Applied in order by the migration runner (pnpm db:migrate). Safe to re-run.
-- ============================================================
--
-- Two things at once, because they are the same feature:
--
--  1. A job listing gets a stable public URL that anyone can open without an
--     account — `/jobs/{public_slug}`.
--  2. A scheduled workflow picks one listing at a time, posts it to the Jobak
--     LinkedIn page with that URL, and records that it did.
--
-- The selection rule is the interesting part. Posting "the newest job" every
-- time means posting ten backend roles in a row whenever a backend-heavy
-- collection lands, which reads as a bot and serves nobody looking for a
-- designer. So the cursor walks the *role catalogue* and each post is the newest
-- unposted job for the next role in the rotation. Variety across roles, recency
-- within one.

 * Separate from `collection_cursor` on purpose: they walk the same catalogue at

 * a few times a day — and sharing one position would let the faster one drag the
 * slower one past roles it never posted.

/*
 * Walks the role catalogue from the cursor and returns the newest unposted job
 * for each role it can fill, up to `p_batch`.
 *
 * Deliberately does **not** mark anything as posted. LinkedIn can refuse a post
 * for a dozen reasons, and a queue that marks on selection loses a listing every
 * time one does. The workflow calls `mark_linkedin_posted` only after LinkedIn
 * confirms — see n8n/jobak-post-linkedin.json.
 *
 * The cursor advances regardless, including past roles with nothing to post.
 * Otherwise a role nobody is hiring for would block the rotation forever.
 *
 * Read and advance happen under one row lock, so two overlapping runs cannot
 * select the same job and post it twice.
