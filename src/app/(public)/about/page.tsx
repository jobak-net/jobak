        Jobak is an AI-powered job matching platform. You describe what you are looking
        for once, and it searches job platforms on your behalf, then ranks what it finds

The work is repetitive and it is the kind of work software should be doing. Jobak automates the searching and the first pass of judgement, so the part left for you is deciding which of the strong matches to actually apply to.",

    title: "How it works",
    body: "Onboarding asks six questions: remote or on-site, where you are, your field and skills, the type of role, your seniority, and a salary range. That profile drives an n8n workflow which searches job platforms for openings that fit. Every listing that comes back is scored from 0 to 100 by a Groq model against your profile, and the results land on your dashboard sorted by that score.",
  },
  {
    title: "What it costs",

    title: "Open source",
