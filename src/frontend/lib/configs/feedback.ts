/**
 * Shared shape for the feedback form.
 *
 * Separate from `backend/actions/feedback.ts` because that file is
 * `"use server"`, and a server-action module may only export async functions —
 * exporting a constant from it fails the build with an error that does not name
 * the constant.
 *
 * The categories live here rather than in the form so the server can validate
 * against the same list the user picked from, and the database `CHECK` in
 * `db/supabase/011_feedback.sql` holds the same values a third time. Three copies is
 * deliberate: the UI offers, the server verifies, the database enforces.
