/**
 * The shape of the job title catalogue, and the pure helpers that read it.
 *
 * The catalogue itself is no longer here. It lives in the `job_fields` and
 * `job_titles` tables — see `db/supabase/004_job_catalogue.sql` — because two things
 * need it and they were reading two different copies: the onboarding dropdown
 * bundled this file, while the hourly collector had to call the app to get at
 * it. One table, both readers, no drift.
 *
 * Fetch it server-side with `getJobCatalogue()` from
 * `@/backend/actions/job-catalogue` and pass it down; these helpers take what
 * you fetched rather than reaching for a module-level array.
