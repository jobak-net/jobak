 * Both surfaces render nothing while the list is empty, so a placeholder can
 * never ship — and a placeholder tip address is not a cosmetic bug, it is money
 * sent to a stranger or to nowhere, discovered only when someone tries it.
 *
 * To add BTC and USDT:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export const supportWallets: SupportWallet[] = [
 *     { network: "Bitcoin",        address: "PASTE_YOUR_BTC_ADDRESS" },
 *     { network: "USDT (TRC-20)",  address: "PASTE_YOUR_TRON_ADDRESS" },
 *     { network: "USDT (ERC-20)",  address: "PASTE_YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS" },
 * ];
 * ```
 *
 * The markers are deliberately not valid addresses: uncommenting this without
 * filling it in produces something obviously broken rather than something that
 * silently accepts a transfer.
 *
 * Before shipping any address:
 *
 *  1. **Copy it out of the wallet app.** Never retype, never transcribe from a
 *     screenshot — one wrong character is an irrecoverable loss.
 *  2. **Check `network` matches the chain the address belongs to.** A TRON
 *     address starts `T`; an Ethereum/BSC address starts `0x`; they are not
 *     interchangeable even though both can hold "USDT".
 *  3. **Send a test transfer of the smallest amount you can** from a different
 *     wallet, and confirm it arrives, before the address is public.
 *  4. **Use a receive-only address** you are happy to have indexed forever. This
 *     goes on a public page; it will be scraped and it cannot be recalled.
